# Facebook Scraper

Scrape Facebook public pages without an API key. Inspired by [twitter-scraper](https://github.com/kennethreitz/twitter-scraper).


## Install

```sh
pip install facebook-scraper
```


## Usage

Send the unique **page name** as the first parameter and you're good to go:

```python
>>> from facebook_scraper import get_posts

>>> for post in get_posts('nintendo', pages=1):
...     print(post['text'][:50])
...
The final step on the road to the Super Smash Bros
We’re headed to PAX East 3/28-3/31 with new games
```

### CLI usage
```sh
$ facebook-scraper --filename nintendo_page_posts.csv --pages 1 nintendo
```
Use
```sh
$ facebook-scraper --help
```
for more details on CLI usage

### Optional parameters

- **group**: group id, to scrape groups instead of pages. Default is `None`.
- **pages**: how many pages of posts to request, usually the first page has 2 posts and the rest 4. Default is 10.
- **timeout**: how many seconds to wait before timing out. Default is 5.
- **sleep**: how many seconds to sleep between each request. Default is 0.
- **credentials**: tuple of user and password to login before requesting the posts. Default is `None`.
- **extra_info**: bool, if true the function will try to do an extra request to get the post reactions. Default is False.


## Post example

```python
{'post_id': '2257188721032235',
 'text': 'Don’t let this diminutive version of the Hero of Time fool you, '
         'Young Link is just as heroic as his fully grown version! Young Link '
         'joins the Super Smash Bros. series of amiibo figures!',
 'time': datetime.datetime(2019, 4, 29, 12, 0, 1),
 'image': 'https://scontent.flim16-1.fna.fbcdn.net'

 'link': 'https://bit.ly/something'}
```


### Notes

- There is no guarantee that every field will be extracted (they might be `None`).
- Shares doesn't seem to work at the moment.
- Group posts may be missing some fields like `time` and `post_url`.
